Welcome to my readme.txt file for this Assignment 4!

GT EMAIL: JMODI30@GATECH.EDU

LANGUAGE: PYTHON
METHOD: JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS

The code for the entire project is written in a single file, to make it easier to process!
If you have Anaconda Navigator, all relevant libraries are already accessible and ready to use. If not, please take a look at the file labeled "pip-requirements-a4.txt" (thanks to Varun Dave for the idea). 

**To run the code**

The setup:
Each Markov Decision Process problem is defined and clearly explained in the writeup titled "JMODI30-Analysis". Please look there for further details.

There are three .ipynb notebooks for this assignment that I have created. They are in the Box file linked in below. 

Please set up an environment that supports .ipynb files. This could be Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, or the Anaconda Navigator environment. Then, on the top, clicks "Cells" > "Run All".

Code and all relevant graphs used in analysis can be found above. The link expires on January 25th, 2024.

Because of the permitted usage of GenAI tools, I utilized ChatGPT to help answer questions about my datasets, as well as Sklearn's modules, and LaTex syntax for Overleaf. The link to my conversation is attached here: https://chat.openai.com/share/5c170813-bacd-4bdb-b7f4-455d716f5328

Happy coding!
